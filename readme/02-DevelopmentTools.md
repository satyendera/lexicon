# Editor & Plugins (Editor Extensions)

## VS Code

We prefer to use VSCode as our source code editor because it is powerful and extensible. VS Code helps makes us instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets et al. It also includes built-in support for IntelliSense code completion, rich semantic code understanding and navigation, and code refactoring.
With great variety of extensions, we were able to make it even more useful for our every day developement and debugging.
